# What is needed to train the network
I've used .jpg pictures from the folder /flowers as a default, but that default can be changed however you need it in order to train the network for different pictures. 

#Train the network
Run the command line:
python train.py
in order to train the network

#Make predictions
Run the command line:
python predict.py 
to getpredictions for your images. As a default you will get the top 5 predictions.
